# C/C++ Console Template Specific Documentation

> ⚠️ **WARNING:**  This is just the documentation part specific of this template. **For the complete and general Torizon IDE documentation, check the [developer website documentation](https://developer.toradex.com/torizon/application-development/ide-extension/)** ⚠️

All projects follow the pipeline of tasks described in the [common contributing documentation](https://github.com/toradex/vscode-torizon-templates/blob/bookworm/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-templates). However, each project has its own specificities in terms of technologies and methods used to compile, deploy, and debug the code. Therefore, each of them has their own specific tasks in the `tasks.json` file.

This C++ console template uses Makefile to compile the code, with tasks named `build-makedir-\${architecture}` (creates the destination directory for the future compiled code) and `build-debug-\${architecture}` (compiles the code). It also uses an SDK container to cross-compile the code. This container image is built using the `Dockerfile.sdk` file, and the tasks that build the containers are named `build-container-image-sdk-\${architecture}`.

The compiled code is then copied into the container, in the `torizon_app_root` (which is automatically passed to the `APP_ROOT` variable in the `Dockerfiles`) directory defined at `settings.json`, through the Docker `COPY` command.

The task that has the entire pipeline of executed tasks, from the first step to the last step before the debugging, is the `deploy-torizon-\${architecture}` task.

Finally, remote debugging is performed by attaching to the GDB on the running container on the device using a [VSCode feature called Pipe Transport](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/pipe-transport). For local debugging, the [VSCode method for C/C++ Debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/launch-json-reference) is used. The tasks that perform the debugging are those present in the `launch.json` file.

The source code of the template is a simple Hello World (Hello Torizon, actually) in C++, using Makefile as build system.

## Makefile Tools (Extension) Pop-up Message

If the project is stuck when trying to debug it, check if the pop-up message below is shown on the bottom-right corner of VSCode. If it doesn't, press `F1` and type `Developer: Reload Window`, and then it will be shown. If it does, click on the `Yes (don't show again)` option.

## Addapting this template to use GCC instead of G++

You can easily addapt this template to use GCC instead of G++, by changing it to `gcc` in the following places:

- `CC` on `Makefile`. From:
  ```
  CC := g++
  ```
  To:
  ```
  CC := gcc
  ```

- `CC` of `build-debug-<arch>` tasks on `.vscode/tasks.json`. From:
  ```
  "CC=<compiler-arch>-g++",
  ```
  To:
  ```
  "CC=<compiler-arch>-gcc",
  ```

- `make` command of `Dockerfile`. From:
  ```
  RUN if [ "$IMAGE_ARCH" = "arm64" ] ; then \
        make ARCH=${IMAGE_ARCH} CC=aarch64-linux-gnu-g++ ; \
    elif [ "$IMAGE_ARCH" = "arm" ] ; then \
        make ARCH=${IMAGE_ARCH} CC=arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++ ; \
    elif [ "$IMAGE_ARCH" = "amd64" ] ; then \
        make ARCH=${IMAGE_ARCH} CC=x86_64-linux-gnu-g++ ; \
    fi
  ```
  To:
  ```
  RUN if [ "$IMAGE_ARCH" = "arm64" ] ; then \
        make ARCH=${IMAGE_ARCH} CC=aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc ; \
    elif [ "$IMAGE_ARCH" = "arm" ] ; then \
        make ARCH=${IMAGE_ARCH} CC=arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc ; \
    elif [ "$IMAGE_ARCH" = "amd64" ] ; then \
        make ARCH=${IMAGE_ARCH} CC=x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc ; \
    fi
  ```
